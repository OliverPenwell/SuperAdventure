Learning C# by designing a simple RPG.

Am unfamiliar with C#, so am following the [Lessons by Scott Lilly](https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/) and making my first game over the summer break!

SimpleRPG had naming issues, and ended up not quite so simple. This replaces it.
